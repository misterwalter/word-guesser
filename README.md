# word-guesser

A little MLish experiment meant to guess at words that could be part of a language. It doesn't use any libraries or anything, it's just me messing around to see what I can do with the simplest possible setup.

Currently tested with English and Spanish, but the dictionaries themselves are not included because I don't feel like worrying about any copyright concerns. Dictionaries need only be one word per line, and that is all.

## Current metric:

-Previous letter

## Planned for Someday:

-Previous two letters

-Position in word (first letter, second letter, etc)

-Previous letter is vowel/consonant

## Examples:

python3 wordguesser.py english

python3 wordguesser.py espanolShort

python3 wordguesser.py oddly_named-dictionary.jpeg
