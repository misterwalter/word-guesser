# word-guesser
Walter Verburg 2016
A little AI  experiment meant to guess at words that could be part of a language. Building this more as a step towards larger plans than a real project, but I wanted to have a little something out on my GitHub, so we'll lead with this. 8)
If someone else can see and learn from this, or tell me how to do it better then that's all the better.
Currently tested with English and Spanish, but the dictionaries themselves are not included because I don't feel like worrying about any copyright concerns. Dictionaries need only be one word per line, and that is all.

Currently metric:
-Previous letter

I plan to add:
-Previous two letters
-Position in word (first letter, second letter, etc)
-Previous letter is vowel/consonant


Example:

python3 wordguesser.py espanolShort
